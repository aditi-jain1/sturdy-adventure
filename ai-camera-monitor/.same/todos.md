- [x] **Interactive prompting** - Click to add positive/negative prompts

### Current Issues (Debugging)
- [ ] **Segmentation not working** - User reports no segmentation results
- [ ] **SAM2 call verification** - Need to confirm service methods are being invoked
- [ ] **Performance debugging** - Check if encoding/segmentation actually runs
- [ ] **Error handling** - Better error messages when segmentation fails

### Integration with Detection Pipeline
- [x] **SAM2 component integration** - Added to CameraFeed component
- [x] **State management** - Enable/disable, initialization status
- [x] **Result handling** - Capture segmentation results and cropped images
- [ ] **Detection enhancement** - Use segmented regions for improved analysis
- [ ] **Motion-aware segmentation** - Only segment areas with detected motion

### UI Enhancements for Segmentation
- [x] **Segmentation overlay** - Canvas-based mask visualization
- [x] **Interactive prompting** - Click to segment objects in real-time
- [x] **Mask visualization** - Different colors for different objects
- [x] **Segmentation controls** - Enable/disable, performance indicators
- [x] **Performance indicators** - Processing time, GPU usage, demo mode status
